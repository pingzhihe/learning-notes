LeSS places a special emphasis on the <strong>coordination between multiple teams</strong>.</p><p>In LeSS, Sprint Planning is divided into two parts and involves multiple teams: <strong>Sprint Planning 1</strong>: Focuses on determining what work will be selected from the product backlog. <strong>Sprint Planning 2</strong>: Focuses on how the work will be done, including task breakdown and assignment across teams.</p><p>LeSS is a scaled-up version of one-team Scrum a single Product Backlog (because it’s for a product, not a team), one Definition of Done for all teams, one Potentially Shippable Product Increment at the end of each Sprint, one Product Owner, many complete, cross-functional teams one Sprint.</p><p><strong>The benefits of LeSS</strong> bridging the gap between business and technical teams through a single Product Owner; a focus on the complete product; direct contact between customers, business stakeholders, and the team; and reduced adoption costs due to the existing use of Scrum methods by teams.</p><p>Scrum@Scale Scrum of Scrums</p><p><strong>Scrum Master Cycle</strong> Team Process, Cross-Team Coordination, Executive Action, Team Continuous Improvement &amp; Impediment Removal. <strong>How?</strong></p><p><strong>Product Owner Cycle</strong> Strategic Vision Backlog Prioritization Executive Metascrum Backlog Decomposition &amp; Refinement Release Planning <strong>What?</strong></p><p>They share <strong>Metrics &amp; Transparency</strong>, <strong>Product &amp; Release Feedback</strong></p><p><strong>Executive Action Team in Scrum@Scale</strong> The Executive Action Team (EAT) fulfills the Scrum Master accountabilities for an entire agile organization.
